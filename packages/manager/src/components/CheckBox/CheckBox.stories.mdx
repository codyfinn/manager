# CheckBox

## Usage
- Used when there are lists of options and the user may select any number of choices, including none, one, or many.
- A stand-alone checkbox is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off. Example: accepting terms and conditions.

## Guidelines
- Visually present groups of choices as groups, and clearly separate them from other groups on the same page.
- Lay out lists vertically, with one choice per line.
- Write checkbox labels so that users know what will happen if they check a particular box.
- Checkboxes often default to having none of the options selected.
- Changed settings should not take effect until the user clicks the action button.
- If the user clicks the Back button, any changes made to checkboxes should be discarded and the original settings reinstated.
